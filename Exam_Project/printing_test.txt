Sequences_selector
 Given a FASTA file it selects sequences that satisfy
the criterias defined by the parameters.
options:
-x <nth_sequence>		 --extracts the nth sequence if presents, the first sequence is the number 1
-X <from_sequence> <to_sequence> --extracts from the <from_sequence> to the <to_sequence> sequences if present, extremes included
-H <header_string>		 --extacts all the sequences that contain <header_string> (case insensitive)in the header section
-C <content_string>		 --extracts all the sequences that contain <content_string> (case sensitive)in the content section of the sequence
-O <output_file>		 --saves the output to the specified <output_file>
-h 				 --displays this help

FASTA comment that may be present in the file will be ignored. The only accepted symbol to indicate an header line is the '>' 
(semicolon not allowed even if on the first line).
If no options are specified then the whole file will be returned without any potential comment.
